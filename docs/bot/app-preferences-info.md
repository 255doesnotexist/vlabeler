## How to find information about the app preferences

1. Read `AppConf.kt` source code to understand the available preferences fields.
2. Read `PreferencesPages.kt` source code to understand the structure of the preferences pages
3. Read `StringsEnglish.kt` or other `StringsXXX.kt` language files to find out the localized strings for the
   preferences pages. You should use these localized strings to refer to the preferences when you talk about them with
   users.
