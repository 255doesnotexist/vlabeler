## How to find information about the app preferences

1. The following files are written in Kotlin:
2. Read `AppConf.txt` source code to understand the available preferences fields.
3. Read `PreferencesPages.txt` source code to understand the structure of the preferences pages
4. Read `StringsEnglish.txt` or other `StringsXXX.txt` language files to find out the localized strings for the
   preferences pages. You should use these localized strings to refer to the preferences when you talk about them with
   users.
